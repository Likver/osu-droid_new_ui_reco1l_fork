# Before you create an issue, you should know that:
- Main team members can only understand English and Chinese, so please use these 2 languages.
- Do not ask questions about some general topics without any suggestions, otherwise we can't get any extra information, because we already know the things you're talking about.
- Bug reports should not be duplicate, and if you found a bug, you should ask for help in the Discord server or QQ first.
- An issue with your actual work (such as a pull request that solves your issue) will be helpful.
